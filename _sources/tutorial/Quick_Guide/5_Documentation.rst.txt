Tutorial: Project documentation
*******************************

Radii projects can be documented in a number of ways. This tutorial will show you how to document a presentation by saving or recording it. 
Saving geometry and controls separately has proven a useful practice, they can be loaded into the viewer speratily later. Making the individual files smaller and quicker to save.

Radii file diagram 

**From Rhino Grasshopper:**

- with the `Save Content`_ component
  - save everything that is connected as a radii file to be used locally
  - save everything to the cloud


**Viewer:**

Everything that was received by the Viewer during a session can be saved locally through the `Remote Content Menu`_, save menu.
It can then be opened through the import option in the same menu. 
With this method you could for example save a presentation at its end to explore it further at a later time.

Screen record video
--------------------
This method might need a stronger or separat pc to work smoothly. 
An open source screenrecoder that we found useful and relatively easy to use is OBS. 
It can be found under https://obsproject.com/
